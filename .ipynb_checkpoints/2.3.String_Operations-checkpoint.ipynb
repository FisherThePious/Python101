Of the album's nine tracks, four were written by Jackson. Seven singles were released from the album, all of which reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Three of the singles had music videos released. \"Baby Be Mine\" and \"The Lady in My Life\" were the only tracks that were not released as singles from the album.\n",
